Introduction
---
This project contains to part to study various properties of Internet Movie Database.

1. explore the properties of a directed actor/actress network.
2. explore the properties of an undirected movie network.

Instruction
---
1. We move all data to Folder Data, change every read file data to Data/file.
1. mergefile.sh is for merging file, run it before start!
2. question{x}\_{R/py}.ipynb represents for the code for the question x in R or in python. For most of the time, we use python to do the data preprocessing, such as mapping the movie name to the movie id. We use R to analysis the graph. Thus, if there two files for one question, run the python file first to generate the required file (such as edgelist.txt, movieid\_genre.txt, or movieid_rating.txt) and then run the R file to do the operations on the graph. 
3. We map the actors' name and movies' name to the ids. The details of mapping can be found in the movie\_id_map.txt and actor\_name\_id\_map.txt
